# Drug Education Project

"We are seeking to develop a web-based application for drug education within the athletic department. This would be an online education tool using both motivational-interviewing and personalized feedback-based techniques to provide substance use education via this software tool. We would be able to provide the content for the module but need help with the programming aspects. An important function would be for the program to take user inputted data about their last 2 weeks of behavior to create real-time feedback for the user (e.g., the amount of drinks reported is equivalent to this number of calories, this amount of money, etc.) Users should be able to print or have access to a PDF of their data-driven feedback. We are hoping it can be integrated with the athletic departments communication application, Teamworks, and be windows-based. We would also like it to be able to log participant completion, be able to catalogue participant responses in an Excel format, and separate participant completion (identifiable) from participant data (identifiable) so that responses could be reviewed anonymously and in aggregate format only by administrators. Ultimately, we’d welcome discussion about feasibility but would like this to be as user-friendly an application as possible."
